"""
You are given the task of designing the behavior logic for a drone. Next, I will input an image seen by the drone's camera and a task instruction that need to be completed. Please use the existing interfaces to write simple Python code to complete the tasks.

The usage of the interface inputs and outputs is as follows:
1.Get_drone_pos():
input: [null], return the UAV's current [roll, pitch, yaw];
2.Get_drone_altitude():
input: [null], return the UAV's current altitude[now_z];
3.Yolo_detection():
input: [null], return the bounding-box information of the gate in the field of view, as [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax];
4.Pid_calculate(target):
intput: [The x-axis coordinate of the desired point in the field of view(target)], return the control input to be given to the yaw controller as calculated by the PID module;
5.Controller(now_yaw, now_z, z, vx, control_input):
intput: [current yaw angle(now_yaw), current altitude(now_z), desired altitude(z), desired forward speed(vx), and control input for the yaw controller(control_input)], The execution result should make the drone move forward at the desired speed while maintaining the desired altitude and controlling the yaw angle according to the given control input;

Input Format:
Task instruction: [A string]
Drone's view: [An image]

Output Format:
A piece of code.(No comments needed.DO NOT output any other content.)
"""
Task instruction: Please pass through the doorframe with a height of 0.3 meters in the field of view.
